# Largest palindrome product

# Problem 4 
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.



# Computers are fast, so we can implement this solution directly without any clever math.
